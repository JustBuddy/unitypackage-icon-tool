# BUDDYWORKS UnityPackage Icon Tool

A patch to the Unity Export window which lets you set an image that is shown when someone is about to import your unitypackage. The selection is remembered across exports of the same project.

**Image Specifications**
- Low resolution. (should not exceed 128×128, it's small anyway.)
- Image should be squared, else it will be squished.
- Must be a .png
